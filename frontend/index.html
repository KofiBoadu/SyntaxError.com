       Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. 
       The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP.

       Web programming can be briefly categorized into client and server coding. The client side needs programming related to accessing data from users and providing information. 
       It also needs to ensure there are enough plug ins to enrich user experience in a graphic user interface, including security measures.
       To improve user experience and related functionalities on the client side, JavaScript is usually used. It is an excellent client-side platform for designing and implementing Web applications.
       HTML5 and CSS3 supports most of the client-side functionality provided by other application frameworks.
       The server side needs programming mostly related to data retrieval, security and performance. Some of the tools used here include ASP, Lotus Notes, PHP, Java and MySQL. 
       There are certain tools/platforms that aid in both client- and server-side programming. Some examples of these are Opa and Tersus.

        project-based learning is a learning technique that focuses heavily on building real-world projects. The alternative is following tutorials,
         but that is ineffective and many times, you'll forget what you learn from a course or tutorial series because you're typically consuming a lot of information without applying it. 
        Thus, you don't truly understand a concept and waste a lot of your precious time trying to follow tutorials.
        <br>
        On the other hand, project-based learning, if done correctly, lets you get a feel of the basics through simple tutorials (preferably by reading the docs or watching youtube) and then immediately building what you want once you gain enough understanding to start writing your own code. 
        Project-based learning is also powerful for building your portfolio and padding your resume. Portfolio websites are really popular nowadays, so this is a great way to fill up the "projects" section. But even if your goal isn't to switch careers, it's very impressive to have 10+ projects which you can claim as your own and show to your friends and family. 
        And remember, employers want to see proof rather than words.
